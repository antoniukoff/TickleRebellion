## Description
In "Tickle Rebellion," you're a farmer defending your land from an alien invasion using an unexpected weapon: tickling. You are to defeat aliens across three increasingly difficult waves. The unique twist? You tickle the invaders to victory.

## Controls
- **Move**: Use the mouse to navigate the game space.
- **Shoot**: Left-click to unleash your tickle powers on the aliens.

## Gameplay
- **Objective**: Survive three waves of alien attacks. Each wave has a different number of aliens and increases the spawn rate.
- **Power-Ups**: Large tickle hands drop from the last enemy of each wave. Shoot these at the alien spaceship to destroy the ship, if missed you reset the waves and start the challenge again.

Prepare for a battle filled with laughter, strategy, and the power of tickling.
